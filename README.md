# ECM3412 Nature-Inspired Computation Coursework

## Description
The python file - 'Ant Colony Optimisation.py' is a runnable program that outputs the best solution for the travelling saleman problem on a given city found during the runtime. By varying the parameters I was able to optimally tune the algorithm's exploration vs exploitation feature, the report file contains analysis of the results in addition to further discussion about the algorithm.

## Installation

The packages xmltodict and numpy are used in this program, if not already installed, run the commands: <br>
pip install xmltodict <br>
pip install numpy <br>
to install the correct packages.

## Configuration

The parameters for the ACO are in all caps at the top of the program, changing these parameters will alter the performace of the ant colony. The filename of the distance xml file is also found at the top of the code, currently this folder contains 'Burma.xml' and 'Brazil.xml' but the program will work on any xml file given it follows the same format.
